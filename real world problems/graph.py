#our hoary culture had several great persons since time immemorial and king Vikramaditya's nava ratnas belongs to this ilk. among these, Varahamihira was an astrologer of eminence and his book brihat jataak is reckoned as the ultimate authority in astrology. 
#he was once talking with Amarasimha, author of Amarakosha. he wanted to know the final position of a person who starts from the origin(0,0) and travels per scheme.
#he first turns and travels 10 units of distance
#his second turn is upwards for 20 units
#third turn is to the left for 30 units
#fourth turn is the downward for 40 units
#fifth turn is to the right for 50 units
#and thus he travels, every time inc the travel distance by 10 units.
